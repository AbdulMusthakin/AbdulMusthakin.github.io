The other day, whilst typesetting some number-theory notes, I needed to mention a characteristic function. A characteristic/indicator function is a function $𝟙: X \subseteq A \to \{0, 1\}$ given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
𝟙_A(x) \colonequals \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in A, \\
0 & \text{if } x \notin A.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

What is the problem? Obviously, there is no issue in conveying the idea, so that will not be the subject of this post. Instead, I want to bring up the problem of the symbol used to represent the function. The $\LaTeX$ `amssymb` package features the `\mathbb` function for a blackboard bold typeface. Unfortunately, we only get capital letters (and lowercase 'k').

The way I used a blackboard bold one above was with Unicode, which gives us all of the numbers: 𝟘, 𝟙, 𝟚, 𝟛, 𝟜, 𝟝, 𝟞, 𝟟, 𝟠, 𝟡. These look pretty good, so what is the issue? Well, they differ stylistically from what is generated by `\mathbb`, but I do not care about that too much. The actual problem is that I cannot use them.

If I wanted to use Unicode characters in my document, I would need a $\TeX$ engine such as LuaTeX or XeTeX, whilst I am currently using pdfTeX. The latter is the fastest, though the only reason I use it is because it was the default one.

**Note:** I do not exactly know what a $\TeX$ engine actually is. I could not tell you what $\LaTeX$ is either without searching it up, so it is not too big of a deal.

Quite a bit of time was spent searching for an alternative, but nothing could be found. I do not doubt that I could stitch up a 'perfect' solution, staying with pdfTeX, given enough time. However, that would be quite a bit of time allocated towards something that does not mean much.

I settled with the typeface obtained using `\mathdf` from the `dsfonts` package. The double-struck one looked fine, but it was quite different from the rest of the blackboard bold typeface. That is why I made the final change with the following lines of code.

```Latex
\newcommand{\bbone}{\text{\usefont{U}{bbold}{m}{n}1}}
\MakeRobust{\bbone}
```
