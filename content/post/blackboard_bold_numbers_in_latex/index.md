The other day, whilst typesetting some number-theory notes, I needed to mention a characteristic function. A characteristic/indicator function is a function $𝟙: X \subseteq A \to \{0, 1\}$ given by

$$
\begin{equation*}
𝟙_A(x) \colonequals \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } x \in A, \\
0 & \text{if } x \notin A.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

What is the problem? Obviously, there is no issue in conveying the idea, so that will not be the subject of this post. Instead, I want to bring up the problem of the symbol used to represent the function. The $\LaTeX$ `amssymb` package features the `\mathbb` function for blackboard bold letters. Unfortunately, it does not go beyond that. We only get capital letters (and lowercase 'k').

The way I used a blackboard bold one above was with Unicode, which gives us all of the numbers: 𝟘, 𝟙, 𝟚, 𝟛, 𝟜, 𝟝, 𝟞, 𝟟, 𝟠, 𝟡. These look pretty good, so what is the issue? Well, they differ stylistically from what is generated by `\mathbb`, but I do not care about that too much.
